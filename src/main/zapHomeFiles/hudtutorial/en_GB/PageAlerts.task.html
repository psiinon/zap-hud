	<h2>Task</h2>
	An informational alert will be raised for this page once it has been passively scanned.<br>
	Keep an eye out for the Informational Level Page Alerts tool on the left hand side changing from a '0' to a '1'. 
	Once that has happened you can click on the tool to see a list of all of the Informational alerts.
	A single type of alert can apply to many pages, or even to multiple elements within a page, 
	so each alert will have a list of URLs that it applies to.<br>
	Click on the alert name to see all of the instances, and then click on the URL to see the alert details.
	The key that you need to supply is given in the alert description.
