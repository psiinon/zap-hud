	There's another frame added to the bottom of every page, and that adds another set of tools that you can use.
	<p>
	The History tab shows all of the requests that have been made by your browser since you opened this page.
	These can be requests for resources like images or JavaScript files, or they can be API requests.
	<p>
	If new pages are requested after the page loads then the tab will show a count of these requests - 
	if you see that keeps going up then that will probably indicate that the page is making a series of API requests.
	<p>
	You can click on the tab or on the arrow button on the right hand side to show and hide the list of the requests,
	and you can click on any of the requests to see full details of the requests and responses.
