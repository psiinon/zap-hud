	<h2>Task</h2>
	A low level alert will be raised for a JavaScript file that this page includes once it has been passively scanned.<br>
	As the alert is not on this page you will not see it in the Page Alert tools, 
	but you will still see it in the Low Level Site Alerts tool on the right hand side. 
	Once it has been raised you can obtain the key via that alert.
